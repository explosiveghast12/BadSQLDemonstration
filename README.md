## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python
2. Install MariaDB
3. pip install mysql-connector-python
4. (in the directory) python squill.py

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Use a text editor
* I used VSCode which allows you to run python with a button

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [MySQL Connector Examples](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-example-connecting.html)
* [Geeksforgeeks SQL Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-cheat-sheet/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make a python library that automatically formats commands for you (this probably already exists though)
